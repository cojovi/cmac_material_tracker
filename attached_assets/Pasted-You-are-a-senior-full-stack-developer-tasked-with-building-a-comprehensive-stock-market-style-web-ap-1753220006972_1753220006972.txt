You are a senior full-stack developer tasked with building a comprehensive stock market-style web application for internal company material pricing management. Create a detailed technical specification and implementation plan for this project.

**Project Requirements:**

**Core Application Structure:**
- Build a stock market-style dashboard for inter-company material pricing
- Materials have frequent price changes (multiple times per month)
- Display format: Stock name (Material Name), Stock Exchange (Distributor), Stock Ticker Symbol (Internal ID), Price
- Backend: Database-driven architecture
- Frontend: Modern, responsive dashboard interface

**Authentication & Access Control:**
- Supabase defualt and native login auth is fine
- Two-tier user permissions:
  - Standard users: View dashboard, submit price change requests
  - Admin users: Access direct price change form with immediate database updates

**Database Schema (Supabase):**
- Material Name: text input
- Price: text input  
- Location: single-select from [DFW, ATX, HOU, OKC, ATL, ARK, NSH]
- Manufacturer: single-select from [Atlas, Malarky, Tri-Built, CertainTeed, Tamko, GAF, Owens Corning, IKO, Other]
- Product Category: single-select from [Shingle, Accessory, Decking, Underlayment, Ventilation, Flashing, Garage Door, Door Motor, Other]
- Distributor: single-select from [ABCSupply, Beacon, SRSProducts, CommercialDistributors, Other]
- Stock Ticker Mapping: ABCSupply=ABC, Beacon=QXO, SRSProducts=SRS, CommercialDistributors=CDH, Other=OTH

**Key Features:**

1. **Main Dashboard:**
   - Stock market-style material listings with real-time pricing
   - Interactive line graphs with hover tooltips showing date/time
   - Scrolling ticker at top showing all materials with color-coded price changes
   - Last 5 recent price changes section (highlighted in bright colors)
   - Customizable default dashboard per user
   - Additional creative data visualizations and metrics

2. **Price Change Workflow:**
   - Bottom section: Simple request form (Material Name, Distributor, Updated Price) with autocomplete
   - Standard user submissions → Slack channel/bot for manager approval
   - Top-right "Price Change" button → Admin-only immediate update form
   - All changes logged with timestamp and user tracking

3. **Design Requirements:**

   - Modern, futuristic, tech-forward aesthetic
   - Traditional stock market color conventions (red/green for price changes, special bright color for recent changes)

4. **Technical Specifications:**
   - Robust price change tracking and audit logging
   - Real-time data updates
   - Responsive design
   - Integration with Slack API for notifications
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation

**Deliverables Required:**
- Complete application source code
- Detailed README.md with setup instructions
- .env.example file with all required API keys, secrets, and configuration variables
- Database migration scripts
- Deployment instructions

**Additional Creative Elements:**
Include innovative dashboard features that enhance user experience while maintaining the stock market theme. Consider advanced analytics, trend predictions, price alerts, or other relevant business intelligence features.

Provide a comprehensive technical implementation plan including technology stack recommendations, architecture decisions, development timeline, and detailed code structure for this material pricing management system.
